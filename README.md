PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Utilizing time series analysis and forecasting methodologies to predict eye states
that serve as reliable indicators of alertness. By accurately identifying these states, I aim to enhance
workplace safety protocols and reduce accident risks.
OBJECTIVES: My goal is to create an effective system for monitoring alertness in real-time by utilizing
EEG data. I set to develop predictive models with exceptional accuracy by employing time series
forecasting techniques.
METHODOLOGY: The project will employ moving averages, exponential smoothing, advanced
exponential smoothing, multiple regression, auto regression and ARIMA models, processed through R,
focusing on predictive accuracy and real-world applicability.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES: A deployable system capable of real-time alertness detection, significantly
improving safety measures in critical work environments.
RESOURCES: EEG Eye State dataset, R software, and time series analysis libraries like forecast, tseries.
CONCLUSION: By accurately predicting alertness levels, this project aims to introduce a proactive
approach to enhancing safety and efficiency in workplaces.
